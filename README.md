# TASK
TASK 1 - This task is performed in python (Jupiter Notebook), Here I have read the JSON files and populated a database. 

TASK 2 - First, I made a connection between python and PostgreSQL and performed a query in PostgreSQL.  

There are two files for task 2, it is required to run the first query file which is named: Task2_part1.sql.

And then run the second query file which is named: Task2_part2.sql.

And this is the output I have received after performing the SQL query which you can also see from the SQL query.
